#### About Me
Hello! My name is [Jeremy Hartman](#Fun-Facts-About-Me)

*jhartman@ucsd.edu*

I am a third year Marshall Student

This is my favorite Thurgood Marshall quote:
> "Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on."

Here is a fun program I wrote:
```
bool UCSD_is_the_best = true;
while(UCSD_is_the_best){
  cout << "go tritons!";
}
```
